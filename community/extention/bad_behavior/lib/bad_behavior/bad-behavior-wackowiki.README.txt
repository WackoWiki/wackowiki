==========================

Installation
------------

WackoWiki does not support automatic installation of plugins,
so a few manual actions are needed:

1. First, download latest Bad Behavior release from official site
and unzip to your site directory (I guess you've already done that).
Then unzip "bad-behavior-wackowiki.zip" into the Bad-Behavior folder
(so that "bad-behavior-wackowiki.php" and "bad-behavior-generic.php"
reside in one folder).


2. Then open "index.php" (located in root directory of you WackoWiki)
in editor and find this line:

$init->engine('run');

Insert the following line just BEFORE the located line:

require_once('lib/bad_behavior/bad-behavior-wackowiki.php');


3. If you like to enable "screener" cookie for advanced protection,
go to /theme/YOUR_THEME/appearance/ folder (where YOUR_THEME is the
name of theme used on your site), open "header.php" in editor and add
the following line just BEFORE the closing "</head>" tag:

<?php bb2_insert_head() ?>

4. Open "settings.ini" to change Bad Behavior options. For details read
http://bad-behavior.ioerror.us/support/configuration/.

5. The file 'tool_badebehavior.php' contains the admin panel module for Bad Behavior.
Options must still set in "settings.ini", this might change in the future.


That's all - now go to your site and check if it is still working ;)
