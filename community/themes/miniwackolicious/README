MiniWackoLicious Theme 0.9.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MiniWackoLicious is a theme (a.k.a. template) for WackoWiki.


DOWNLOAD AND INSTALLATION ------------------------------------------------------

* Download MiniWackoLicious as ZIP- or TAR.GZ archive, unzip it and copy the
  miniwackolicious directory to your themes folder of the WackoWiki
  installation.
* Edit your config.php (or personal.config.php) and set
  "theme" => "miniwackolicious".
* Your wacko user may also select this theme on the Settings page.


FEATURES -----------------------------------------------------------------------

The theme has been designed for all options you got by the wacko markup. It
contains a small main navigation including the input field for the keyword
search. At the footer you find the link to the login page or – if logged in –
links to the user page, settings and logout. Modern browsers also got a fixed
backend bar at the top of the page when a user is logged in. That's it. Simple
and eye candy.


CUSTOMIZATION ------------------------------------------------------------------

To alternate the HTML just edit header.php and footer.php at the appearance
folder. To change colors/etc and typographical formatting you can edit
screen.css and typography.css at the layout folder.

The main menu can be controlled in appearance/mainmenu.inc.php:

/* == Edit your main menu here ====================================== */
 
$menu = array(
    'WikiSite' => 'Name of Site',
    'YourHomePage' => 'Homepage',
    'http://externlink.com' => 'Go away'
);
 
/* == Stop here! ... and let it flow ================================ */

You can add i18n features when you add those menu targets and their names to the
translation files which you find at lang folder.
