WACKOWIKI INSTALLATION

Unpack/upload the distribution files into a directory that can be accessed via the web.
Then go to the corresponding URL. A web-based installer will walk you through the rest.

Example:

If your website, say, https://www.example.com, is mapped to the directory /home/jdoe/www/,
and you place the Wacko distribution files into /home/jdoe/www/wacko/, you should go to
https://www.example.com/wacko/.

Note that WackoWiki distributions normally unpack into directories that include the version
in their name; you'll probably want to rename those to just "wacko" -- or, if you're
on a unixoid system, set up a symbolic link.


PERMISSIONS:

For configuration purposes, you'll probably want to make config/config.php writable
by the web server, at least temporarily.

Please make sure the following subdirectories are writable, since this is where the files are stored.

Adjust the file permissions according to the permission group you're in.

  chmod 0755 _cache/config/ _cache/feed/ _cache/page/ _cache/query/ _cache/session/ _cache/template/ file/backup/ file/global/ file/perpage/ file/thumb/ file/thumb_local/ xml/
  chmod 666 config/config.php config/lock config/lock_ap

Reset file permissions of the config file after installation.

  chmod 644 config/config.php


Check if the provided path for CACHE_SESSION_DIR in config/constants.php is correct.

  The default value set in constants.php is /tmp but may vary in your environment.
  You may want to change this to a custom folder (e.g. _cache/session or /var/tmp)


IMPORTANT: For installing or upgrading WackoWiki, do NOT access any of the files contained
in the setup/ subdirectory. They're used by the web-based installer/updater, but you
should really just access the WackoWiki directory itself, and it will (or at least should)
work perfectly.


BACKEND:

Create a Recovery-Password to access the Admin panel.

Call the {{admin_recovery}} action as Admin and generate the password hash.
Add the password hash: 'recovery_password' => 'add hash here' in the config/config.php file.
Clear the config cache with the {{admincache}} action.
