Introduction
============

Text_Highlighter is a class for syntax highlighting. The main idea is to
simplify creation of subclasses implementing syntax highlighting for
particular language. Subclasses do not implement any new functioanality, they
just provide syntax highlighting rules. The rules sources are in XML format.
To create a highlighter for a language, there is no need to code a new class
manually. Simply describe the rules in XML file and use Text_Highlighter_Generator
to create a new class.
